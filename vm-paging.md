### Understanding Page Tables and Memory Management

1. **Byte-Addressable Memory**:
   - In a byte-addressable memory system, each unique address points to one byte of memory.
   - A 32-bit address space means that each address in memory is represented by 32 bits, allowing for 2^32 unique addresses.
   - So 2^32 bytes of memory can be addressed with a 32-bit address. (2^32 bytes = 4GB)

2. **Pages and Page Size**:
   - Virtual Memory is divided into small, fixed-size blocks called pages.
   - For example if each page is 4KB (kilobytes) in size, where 1KB = 1024 bytes, so 4KB = 4096 bytes.
   - So each page needs 4096 addresses to address 4096 bytes in the page
   - How many bits would the address need? 12 bits ( since, 2^12 = 4096 )

3. **Virtual Address Structure**:
   - A virtual address is divided into two parts: the Virtual Page Number (VPN) and the offset.
   - **VPN**: Identifies which page we are talking about.
   - **Offset**: Identifies the exact byte within that page.


   **Offset Calculation**:
   - A 4KB page size means we need 12 bits to represent the offset within the page (since 2^12 = 4096 bytes = 4KB).
   - This 12-bit offset allows us to address each individual byte within the 4KB page.

   **VPN Calculation**:
   - The remaining bits (32 - 12 = 20 bits) represent the VPN.
   - With 20 bits we can have how many pages? 2^20 = little more than 1 million

### Number of Translations

1. **Number of Pages (VPNs)**:
   - A 20-bit VPN means there are 2^20 different pages.
   - 2^20 = 1,048,576 (roughly a million pages).

### Page Table Size

1. **Page Table Entry (PTE)**:
   - Each entry in the page table needs to store information about one page.
   - Typically, each PTE is 4 bytes (32 bits), which includes the physical frame number and some control bits.

2. **Total Memory for One Page Table**:
   - With a million pages, and each entry being 4 bytes, the total size of the page table is:
   \[
   1,048,576 \text{ pages} \times 4 \text{ bytes/page} = 4,194,304 \text{ bytes} \approx 4 \text{ MB}
   \]

### Impact of Multiple Processes

1. **Multiple Processes**:
   - If you have 100 processes running, each with its own page table, the memory required multiplies.

2. **Total Memory for All Page Tables**:
   - For 100 processes, the total memory required is:
   \[
   100 \text{ processes} \times 4 \text{ MB/process} = 400 \text{ MB}
   \]

### Why is This a Problem?

1. **Memory Usage**:
   - 400MB of memory just to keep track of where things are in memory is a lot.
   - This is before even considering the actual data and programs that need to be stored.

2. **Efficiency**:
   - Managing such large page tables can slow down the system, as more memory and processing power are required to handle these translations.
