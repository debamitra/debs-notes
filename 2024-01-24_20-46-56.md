This ia my first entry. Its 8:47 pm right now, I am hungry. I feel like I didnt get done much today even though I was focussed on work trying to fix test cango app.
I tried to read the book "Code" by Charles Petzold but I got bored or didnt understand much. I want to go throug e 17th chaper which is about flipflops. Basically memory building blocks. Ill get back to you on what I learnt.
I want to eat dinner. I also want to spend some time on the NAND2Tetris course. I want to get started with the first project which is simulating all 15 basic logic gates. Lets see if I can get to it tonight. Will wrap up the day by reading Jeeves and sleeping by 12-12:30pm. Tomorrow is a new day. You got this Deb!
