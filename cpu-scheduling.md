1. What is **turnaround time**?
     T <sub>completion</sub> - T <sub>arrival</sub>
2. FIFO , Shortest Job First(SJF), Shortest Time-to-completion First are some scheduling algorithms discussed
3. Preemptive(a running job can be stopped before finishing) vs Non-preemptive scheduling.
4. What is **response time**?
     T <sub>firstrun</sub> - T <sub>arrival</sub>
5. Round Robin Scheduling - Fairness
6. STF optimizes for turnaround time.
7. RR optimizes for response time.
